Python, Langchain, OpenAI, &amp; Pinecone stack


## How do I use it?

Run `python loader.py` (one time) to load up some documents into the Pincone Vector DB, and use the Embeddings to save them in a way that can be easily queried later.

Run `python main.py` to query the Wiki system with your questions.
